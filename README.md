	-> convert video to audio<br/>
	-> ectract text<br/>
	-> save text in timeline folder<br/>
	-> check the spelling<br/>
	-> Split voice file according to timestamp (speaker_test folder)<br/>
	-> teacher / student voice classification (make teacher & student folder in speaker_test folder -> audio file)<br/>
	-> teacher / student text classification (make teacher & student in timeline folder -> text file)<br/>
	-> Organize folders<br/>
   ->extract features (TBD / ex.Extracting highly repeated words & Similarity check for each word)<br/>
